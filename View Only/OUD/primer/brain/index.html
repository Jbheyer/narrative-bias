        <h1>    <b> Opioid use disorder</b> – is a severe change that occurs in a persons brain function over time and increases the desire to use. Neuroscientists have concluded that opioid use disorder 
                is a chronic brain disease that changes the biological structures of the brain. The disorder decreases one’s ability to resist the 
                impulse to take opiates – despite the harmful consequences to the individual and to those around him or her.</h1>
