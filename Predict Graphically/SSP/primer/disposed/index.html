                <h2>Pushback on syringe exchange programs often focus around:</h2>
                <ul>
                        <li>Increased use</li>
                        <li>Syringes being ‘ditched’ resulting in accidental needle-sticks in the community</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3><strong><u>Return Rate:</strong></u> Syringe exchange programs offer new syringes in return for ‘used’ ones. The exchange being 1-for-1 or many for many.</h2>
                <h4>Syringe exchange programs provide sharps containers to decrease the number of unproperly disposed used syringes</h3>
                <h5>In <b>2016</b> only <strong>18%</strong> of used syringes were disposed of properly leaving <strong>82%</strong> unaccounted for (Austin, Indiana)</h4>
